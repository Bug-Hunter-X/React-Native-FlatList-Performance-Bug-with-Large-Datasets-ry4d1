This React Native bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and rapid scrolling.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering of list items, blank spaces appearing in the list, or even crashes.  This is often due to inefficient data handling and the component's internal recycling mechanism not keeping up with the rapid changes.
