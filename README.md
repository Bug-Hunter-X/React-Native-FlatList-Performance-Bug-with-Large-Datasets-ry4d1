# React Native FlatList Performance Bug

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets and rapid scrolling. The bug manifests as incorrect rendering, blank spaces appearing in the list, or even crashes. The solution provided addresses this by optimizing data handling and improving the efficiency of the component's rendering process.

## Bug Description
The `FlatList` component, while efficient for many use cases, can struggle when presented with a large amount of data and rapid user scrolling.  Without proper optimization, this leads to performance issues, resulting in visual glitches and potential crashes. 

## Solution
The solution involves using techniques such as `keyExtractor` to efficiently update and identify list items, `windowSize` to control the number of rendered items at any time, and potentially using a virtualized list library for significantly larger datasets.
